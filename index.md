We  are more and more getting  used to using free internet services, and they all look Lightweight. Everyone knows  that Google and Facebook are more valuable than Unicredit and Mercedes. In the  real world, you can see a car or ATM everywhere, but you will only feel  Internet services on a 5-inch digital screen.

In fact, the support of all free Internet services is based on massive resources, especially  for the servers in the data center.
  
However,  information about data centers which are known to the public often comes from Internet search engines,  news media, social media and other media channels. Can public accurately,  objectively and comprehensively understand the opportunities and challenges of  data centers to our society, economy and environment through filtered and screenedÂ   information by these media?
  
We try  to restore a whole picture of the data center in the virtual world for people  in general who want to get to know more about it.
