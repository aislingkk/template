### Description
To further explore the specific content of the 50 links and the entries that appear, we analyze and conclude:

Industry technology companies (such as Google Amazon), they are more concerned about data center applications (Solve, Service, Product, Cloud, Program) and stability (System, Power).
Professional websites pay more attention to: cooling service system application (cloud) and energy consumption (Consumption, Energy Saving).

As for the government aspect (the results are all from Google), the US government's focus on data centers is energy efficiency, cost, and construction.

Based on the above, we can conclude that the top 25 webpages（baidu or google） obtained by search engines are more suitable for decision makers in professional fields, industry organizations and relevant government part. Most of the content is about interested parties in the industry.
