### Description
From this visualization, we can see: in China, Baidu search engine displays more sources of industry information and industry articles, which would attract viewers who are mostly professional and stakeholders people in industry.And in the United States, Google search shows a more comprehensive distribution of sources. Compared to Baidu, that is more comprehensive for the public to know about the data center.

However, whatever China and the United States, sources of information from social media have almost disappeared on the top 25 sources of information links. That shows that the energy consumption of the data center has not attracted strong public attention. Data centers are still the field for related people in the industry.

### Protocol

We correspond to English and Chinese, and search for the "data center energy" query,which gets the top 25 URLs.Then, we imported 50 URLs into the WEBPULSE tool and subjectively sorted the content of the webpage. Finally,we divided the website types into 9 categories (Government, Company Web, Reference, News Media, Education, Social Media, Data Center Web,Forum Web, Charitable Organizations).The website content is divided into 6 categories(“Article, Service, News, Report, Tutorial, Paper”).

We also got 50 URL global rankings through ALEXA.But it publishes less relevant content.Most of these related sites have less influence. Meanwhile, we make manually organization of type of website.Finally, we output all the data (50 URL,Websit Type,Language,Website Ranking) to visualize with Tableau and Illustrator.
