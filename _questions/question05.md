### Description
During the research process, we generated a very curious focus.
Through News Links collected from China and US by two search engines , how is the exposure bias of news media for data center?

After collecting and sorting out, we found that nearly half of the news in the top 100 news (both Baidu and Google) is covered by the green data center of the star company (and almost all positive).Most of the rest of news resources are also around the general discussion of the data center (management, operations, technology, applications, etc.). News reports that are negative about the data center are very rare (for example, data centers are very energy-intensive)

Compared with Google, Baidu News's display results tend to be news events from industry events and conference forums as well as professional websites. This shows that China has the fastest growth rate as a data center and has a strong momentum for the development of data centers. Compared to Baidu, Google News has exposed more star companies' green data centers and industry information, which is in line with the US data center's leadership in terms of quantity and nergy efficiency in global.


### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/protocols_5.png' | relative_url }})

Firstly,we search for "Data Center Energy" in Google News (set to US Regional and English) and Baidu News (sorted by news focus), and collect the top 100 news links by manually defining a series of variables(news media, news subjects, news content, news attitudes, etc) to extract relevant information from news.After inputing data on Excel, we use Raw Graphy to make preliminary visualization and finally improve visualization resultsthrough Illustrator.
